# Feldco Loan Request App

The Feldco Loan Request App is a Feldco in-house mobile application designed for tablet devices that streamlines the
loan application process. Sales representitives may fill out digital application forms with the customer's help and
receive immediate responses from banks without the need for a call center to act as a middleman.

## Current Features

* Sales representatives can log into a tablet application
* Sales representatives can see a list of their clients and select the client with whom they are filling out an
 application
* The client can see and complete a supplement form
* The signed supplement form is sent to a backend server and kept as a record
* The sales representative, with the help of their client, can fill out a bank application form
* A co-applicant can optionally fill out a secondary application form, and fields like home address are automatically copied from the first applicant
* The application form information is validated before being sent to banks
* The completed bank application form is sent to a backend server
* If the loan is approved by Feldco Finance, the sales representative can view Truth in Lending information
* An administrator can modify the order (routing) in which banks receive a client's loan application
* Loan applications are sent to banks based on a qualifying criteria matrix, which takes into account things like the
loan amount and client residence type
* Signed supplement forms are stored as PDFs on a backend server

## Instructions for Continuing Development

You (Feldco) will likely want to continue developing this application. Here are some detailed instructions to guide your
 development team.

### Download and Installation

There are some steps required to set up the frameworks used to develop the application and configure a backend server.

#### Setting up AppGyver Steroids

We built this mobile application using the AngularJS and AppGyver Steroids frameworks. There are some steps required to
get everything set up.

1. [Create an AppGyver account](http://www.appgyver.com/steroids_sign_up)
2. Make sure develloper tools are set up ([Click here](https://academy.appgyver.com/installwizard/steps#/home) for a
guide)

#### Downloading Source Code and Dependencies

1. [Click here](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/archive/master.zip) to download source code
2. Unzip the code and place it in your desired directory
3. Open the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (OSX) in the FeldcoLoanRequest root directory and run:
```
steroids update
```

#### Setting Up Backend Server

The mobile app sends all http requests to a backend server that we developed using the [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
framework. This server is currently hosted on Amazon Web Services. For now, you have the option to either host this
server on your own Amazon account or locally at Feldco. In the future, you may wish to migrate the various API calls
from this new backend server to your current server, which would be easy to do.

##### Option: Hosting on Amazon Web Services

1. [Create an AWS account](http://aws.amazon.com/)
2. Follow [these setup instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/get-set-up-for-amazon-ec2.html)
3. Open the [EC2 Control Panel](https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
4. Navigate to the [AMIs page]
(https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/v2/home?region=us-west-2#Images:visibility=public-images;sort=name)
and search for "ami-1f49702f"

##### Option: Hosting at Feldco

1. Copy the webserver/ directory from this repository to the server machine
2. Navigate to the webserver/ directory and run in Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (OSX): ```npm install -d```
3. Start the express server by running ```node.js```, or install a tool like
[forever](https://github.com/foreverjs/forever) to keep the server running in the background

### Developing the App

We recommend that you read through the basic
[AppGyver Steroids documentation](http://docs.appgyver.com/supersonic/tutorial/first-mile/#overview), noting of course
that you can skip the setup steps.

To test the code, open the Command Line (Windows) or Terminal (OSX) in the FeldcoLoanRequest root directory and run:
```
steroids connect
```
A web page will open containing a QR code that you may scan using the
[AppGyver Scanner app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.appgyver.freshandroid&hl=en) on your tablet.
You may also open an emulator. Instructions for setting up the GenyMotion Android Emulator can be found
[here.](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/cli/emulators/genymotion/)

### Code Tour

* [__app/common/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/app/common): The core mobile app code, in a familiar AngularJS format
* [__config/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/config): Additional data used by AppGyver Steroids to build the app
* [__webserver/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/webserver): The backend server code. This directory completely separate from the mobile application and does not
need to be present for the mobile app to compile. It is intended to be placed either on a machine at Feldco or hosted
elsewhere.
* [__webserver/public/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/webserver/public): Currently not used. If you decide to write a web application with a user interface on this
server, the code will go here.
* [__webserver/routes/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/webserver/routes): The restful API that currently stands in place of the Feldco API.
* [__webserver/uploads/supplements/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/webserver/uploads/supplements): Signed supplement forms are uploaded here.
* [__webserver/views/__](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/webserver/views): Currently not used. If you decide to write a web application with a user interface on this
server, the markdown code will go here.

### Deployment

* Follow [these guidelines](http://docs.appgyver.com/tooling/build-service/build-settings/build-settings-for-android/)
* Once you deploy go to the [cloud services](https://cloud.appgyver.com)
* While in cloud services, when you're configuring the app make sure you name your key_store_app and alias the same as
you named them when you created them.

### Missing Features

Here are a list of features that are missing from the application.

##### Connecting the sales representative login and client list to the Feldco CRM

There are a couple ways of going about this. Should you choose to continue using our backend server, the calls to your API will go inside the [webserver/routes/services.js](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/webserver/routes/services.js) file. Should you choose to have the app contact your APIs directly, you will modify the [app/commom/scripts/bankRequestService.js](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/app/common/scripts/bankRequestService.js) file.

##### Connecting the submitted application forms to real bank APIs

Similarly, you can do this in the [services.js](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/webserver/routes/services.js) file or the [bankRequestService.js](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/app/common/scripts/bankRequestService.js) file. Code will need to be added to map the form fields to the API request object fields.

##### Maintaining records of loan applications

This could be performed simply by modifying [this function](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/webserver/routes/services.js#L128) in the services.js file. 

##### Automatically populate fields of the application form using client data from CRM

Save the selected client in localstorage, or query the Feldco API in the [application form controller](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/app/common/scripts/applicationFormController.js), and set the form scope variables accordingly.

##### Administrator ability to upload bank promotion templetes

This will likely be done via a web portal accessable from a computer. If you continue to use our backend server, you will be adding new routes and views to the [webserver](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/webserver) folder.

##### Ability to view detailed loan approval information

Add a button to the [application status](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/app/common/views/applicationStatus.html) page, add logic to the [application status controller](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/blob/master/app/common/scripts/applicationStatusController.js), and create a new view for this information in the [views](https://github.com/eecs394-spr15/FeldcoLoanRequest/tree/master/app/common/views) folder. You will probably want to save the bank API's response in localstorage for access in this new view.

### Known Issues

* The app sends all form data to a backend server using an unencrypted http protocol. Since confidential client
information is among the form data, we highly recommend securing this connection. This can be accomplished by cutting
out the backend server that we developed and sending all communication directly and securely to the Feldco API.

* The app occasionally crashes when changing views if it is run with the Android AppGyver Scanner, which is likely 
due to [this bug](https://muut.com/i/appgyver/steroids:uncaught-syntaxerror-unexpe). However, when deployed, the app
works fine.
